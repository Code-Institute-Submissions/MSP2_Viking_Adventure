                                The year is 836. The Viking invasion of England is well underway.
                                <br>
                                But all is not well in Norway. Ivar, a humble farmer with dreams of becoming a world renowned drengr (warrior) lives a peaceful life with his family in the foothills of the great Kvenland mountains, but he fears an attack from the violent tribes to the north.
                                <br>
                                One day, his worst fears are brought to life. Invaders attack his settlement, burning and killing as they go. By the luck of the Gods, Ivar manages to flee with his family and what little keepsakes they were able to grab in the escape. Homeless in the wilds of Norway, they know they need help fast.
                                <br>
                                After several days of long travel, Ivar and his family arrive at a nearby settlement, run by the great Jarl Bjorn, his wife Astrid, and his drengr Sigurd. If Ivar and his family stand any chance of finding refuge in the settlement, he must win the favour of these three members of the High Council. But doing so will be difficult.
                                <br>
                                Are you ready?
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>How to play</h3>
                            <p>
                                Navigate through a series of choices using the buttons at the bottom of the screen. Using the four functions, "Talk", "Use", "Challenge" and "Look at", you must win earn the blessings of the three members of the High Council.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Getting Stuck?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Each member of the High Council is looking for something different, and you will need to win over all three to succeed.
                                <br>
                                Jarl Bjorn can be won over with a gift. He has decorated his Longhouse with his prized possessions. Think about what you can offer him.
                                <br>
                                Lady Astrid is a wise woman. To win her favour you must beat her in a game of wits. She is known for her love of riddles.
                                <br>
                                Mighty drengr (warrior) Sigurd will only respect you if you can beat him, but conventional methods may not be your wisest choice. Talk to the other members of the High Council and see if the unbeatable warrior has a weakness.
