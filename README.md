# Introduction

Inspired by classic point and click adventure games such as the Monkey Island series, GAME NAME is a short demo of what will one day become a full length game. 
In the game, we follow Ivar, a Norse farmer with dreams of becoming a famous Viking warrior. After his farm is attacked by an invading army, he and his family are forced to relocate to a larger settlement nearby.
It is here the game begins. In order to secure a place for his family in the new settlement, Ivar must first meet with an win over the high council, made up of three important figures:
Jarl Bjørn Odensson, his wife Astrid, and his prized warrior, Sigurd.
The player will guide Ivar through a series of options, learning more about the three members of the high council, and what exactly they can do to win over each member.
As the Jarl of the settlement, Bjørn has riches beyond his wildest imaginations, so the player must use everything they have in their inventory to create something truly unique to win him over.
Astrid, a wise and wistful poet, is searching for someone to match her intellect, and so challenges Ivar to answer three riddles, each of which he must get right in order to succeed.
Sigurd, a battlehardened drengr (warrior) will only approve of someone who can beat him in battle. While Ivar has access to both a sword and an axe, facing Siguard in combat will end in failure. In order to beat this formidable foe, Ivar must think outside the box...
Only once all three members of the high council have been won over will the player be granted refuge, thus concluding the demo.


# User Experience (UX)

## Project Goals

As a homage to the old point and click adventure games of the nineties, this project aims to provide players with an experience reminscent of those old games. 
The art style, user interface, and puzzles will be themed around this retro style. Offering players a demonstration of what will one day become a much larger game, 
this project aims to deliver an interesting, engaging, puzzle-focused experience that will leave players searching for more.

## User Stories

As a first time player, I want to:
* Understand the premise of the game, and the object required to succeed.
* Be presented with an easily-understood user interface.
* Be able to read instructions on how the game works.
* Navigate through the various challenges presented with help from dialogue and contextual clues.
* Have a bug-free experience.

As a returning player, I want to:
* Discover my progress has been saved in local storage.
* Discover alternative dialogue choices based on using incorrect items with things.
* Be able to play the demo entirely on any screen size I desire and have the interface adapt appropriately.
